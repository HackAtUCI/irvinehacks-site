# irvinehacks-site-2024

## Overview
This monorepo uses [turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as a package manager. It contains the following:

### `apps/site`
A [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) 13 project that uses the new app router.

This app contains the IrvineHacks site.

The development server runs at `http://localhost:3000`. If this port is taken, the next available port will be used.

### `apps/api`
A [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) project.

This app contains the api for the IrvineHacks site.

The development server runs at `http://localhost:8000`. If this port is taken, the next available port will be used.

### `apps/sanity`

A [Sanity Studio](https://www.sanity.io/studio) project.

This app contains the dashboard used to view and edit content stored in [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/).

The development server runs at `http://localhost:3333`. If this port is taken, the project will error.

## First-Time Setup

### Pnpm

This repo used `pnpm`, a space-efficient replacement to `npm`.
You can learn more about its advantages at <https://pnpm.io/>.

Install pnpm with the following command, or use an [alternative installation method](https://pnpm.io/installation).

```shell
npm install -g pnpm
```

When running commands, use `pnpm` rather than `npm`.

### Next.js

1. Ensure you are in the project root.

2. Install dependencies
   ```shell
   pnpm i
   ```

### Python API

1. Ensure you are in `apps/api` with
   ```shell
   cd apps/api
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment. This isolates the libraries you install in this environment from the libraries on your actual machine.

   ```shell
   python3 -m venv .venv
   ```

3. Activate virtual environment

   VS Code may prompt to automatically select the newly created virtual environment.
   Otherwise, for Mac/Linux, run

   ```shell
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
   and for Windows, run

   ```shell
   .\.venv\scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install dependencies
   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

### Docker

This project uses Docker for testing API methods locally.

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). The process varies greatly depending on the operating system, so please refer to this article.

2. Open Docker Desktop.

A local MongoDB application will start running at `http://localhost:8081` after running `pnpm dev`.

*Note*: Because the Python files have been copied over to the Docker container, hot reload is no longer possible. Stopping the container and rerunning `pnpm dev` is the best option.

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command in the project root.

```bash
pnpm build
```

To build an individual app or package, first, navigate to the corresponding directory and run the build command.

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command in the project root.

```bash
pnpm dev
```
